# Data-for-Dessert
Data for dessert is a data science and machine learning initiative that aims to tackle the problem of food deserts and food insecurity by leveraging data from the USDA.

1. Project Title: Data for Dessert
2. Team Name: Food For Thought
3. Group Members: Bryce Harris, Anthony Le, Sergio Rangel-Galvan, George Rook
4. Goal of the project:
To train a machine learning algorithm to identify and score food deserts in
American neighborhoods based on data from the USDA.
5. Benefits (why is this project important?)
Food deserts are one of the biggest problems facing low income communities
today, in 2021 Texas was named one of the most food insecure states in America
(Coleman-Jensen et al.). Our project seeks to use data from the USDA to train a
machine learning algorithm to identify and score neighborhoods experiencing food
insecurity. This project can be used by the government to identify places to invest in
increasing access to healthy food as well as by grocery stores to identify places to
potentially reach underserved markets. Finally, according to KXAN April 21st is Austin
Food Security Awareness Day.
6. Datasets Details
We will use the USDA Food Access Research Atlas to train our algorithm. The
Atlas is a great pool of data featuring several food access indicators as well as census
tract data that is good for city planning as well as research. Due to this being a
government project the data is publicly accessible and encouraged to be used for
research purposes.
7. Train and evaluate a machine learning model.
8. Milestones
Data acquisition Stage: a. Data acquisition and selection b. Data preprocessing.
C. ETL implementation
Model implementation stage: a. algorithm selection b. ml training using data c.
model tuning
d. parameter adjustment e. re-training model
Evaluation Stage: a. accuracy and precision assessment. b. error finding and
boundary case evaluation
Analysis Stage: a. final ml model assessment b. Final testing stage c. Result
collection and collation
Presentation: a. final assessment creation and collation b. Presentation creation
9. Evaluation criteria
9a. Since our ML system is intended to assess whether or not an area is a food
desert, we can compare generated results with other manually created and rated data
systems. Additionally, the USDA Food Access Research Atlas has a map that
determines if a geographic area is a food desert or not.
11. Deliverables (Code, Data, Report)
11a. What kind of code? Where will it be hosted?
The main language that we will use is python and we will be working in a jupyter
notebook since we have become more familiar with it throughout the course. It
will be hosted in a public repository like GitHub, and will include data analysis
and machine learning in order to tackle this issue of food deserts.
11b. What kind of data? Will it be published or does it already exist?
We will use data sources such as the USDA's Food Access Research Atlas.
Then we will clean the data in order for the machine learning to work properly.
11c. IMP: Course project report is mandatory as per the course
requirements. It should be included in deliverables by default.
The project report will be 1500 words in length, the main goal of the report is to
show that we have used the skills that we learned in the class by making the
project understandable, impactful, and reproducible. Furthermore the report will
include the following questions:
● What did you expect before conducting your analysis? Did you have any
hypotheses around the problem, such as features that you expected to be
important or unimportant?
● Why did you select the analysis tools that you used?
● What did you learn from your analysis?
● To what extent do you believe your findings are generalizable to other,
similar contexts (e.g. for Telco churn, to customer churn in general)? Why?
● What is your proposed solution and why did you select it?
● Is your proposed solution fair? Why or why not? How can you tell?
11d. IMP: Presentation (with demos where applicable or analysis of results). It
should be included in deliverables by default
This will be a 10 minute long presentation that clearly communicates what the
project is and its conclusions to the audience .
12. Finding good clean data will be the primary dependency. The USDA Food Access
Research Atlas will be the primary data source, but without further exploration it is
difficult to determine the form of the data. If we expand the data pool, that can introduce
other dependencies that are difficult to assess in advance.
